1) open module settings of project, set the resources package to a resource folder - If fx errors occur this can fix it

isnt query signed up users supposed to be made same as query locked out users - brian

We may want to just have the database as an attribute and when we construct the server it constructs and connects for the database.
That’d make the most logical sense. I can implement it tomorrow

There’s no getID for the client handler, there’s a getID but it’s from the thread API
I remember Bryan mentioning this the other day. May be the root of wh it’s making a new fucking peer connection everytime
bc it’s failing to retrieve the getID for the user that’s interacting or something
It was a bug in Reinharts code
